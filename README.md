# Project-5: Food Calorie Calculator with QR Code Scanning

## Overview

This project is a React-based web application that scans a QR code representing a food dish and calculates its calorie count based on its individual constituents. Users can modify the quantity of individual items in the dish, and the app dynamically updates the calorie calculation. The backend, powered by Node.js and MongoDB, manages the inventory, including CRUD APIs for dishes and their constituent items.

## Key Features

1. **QR Code Scanning**
   - Scan QR codes containing dish information.
   - Decode data such as dish name and constituent items.
   
2. **Dynamic Calorie Calculation**
   - Retrieve calorie data for dish constituents from the database.
   - Display a real-time calorie breakdown and total calories.
   - Allow users to modify the quantity of items and update calorie counts dynamically.

3. **Inventory Management**
   - CRUD APIs for managing dishes and their constituent items.
   - Update calorie values and item details through the backend.

4. **User-Friendly Interface**
   - Intuitive UI for viewing dish details, calorie breakdown, and modifying quantities.
